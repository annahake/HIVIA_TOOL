Due to privacy concerns, we cannot provide the HLA data, nor the clinical data used for this study. 
The raw NGS sequences have been published under under the BioProject ID PRJNA810303. 
The used consensus sequences are published in the supplement of the paper.
An example HLA file as well as a clinical file is provided under ./data/examples/. 
The names of the HLA alleles can be changed in the config file. 
The clinical file is important for extracting the age, sex and ethnicity as variables for the model as well as to ensure that the sequences for the training belong to chronic, treatment-naive patients (cd4_count <200 && onART=NO)
